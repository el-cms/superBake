# Config: defaults
This section holds the default configuration for empty elements in your configuration file. That means if you define elements _without_ all the keys needed, defaults will be used

**Things to know:**

 * All **pathes** must follow this convention: directory separators are `::`.
 * `options` arrays can be simple key/value or multidimensionnal arrays, or both, or a teapot. As you want.
 * `generate` keys are hierarchical: if you set one to false, all the part's child will have them set to false.
 * If you add a key that's not in the defaults list, it will be added to the final config array, making it easy to extend it to suit your needs.

All these parts are in the `defaults` section of your configuration file.

## View

&rarr; [Default views templates](help_templates_views)

---
Views templates are located in the `Sb/Console/Templates/<yourTemplate>/views/` dir.
You can find infos about templates options and configuration on [this help page](help_templates_views)

<pre class="syntax yaml">
##
## This is a default view
##
view:
  ## Path to the template file for the view.
  ## Leave this blank in defaults or all your views will use the same template as default.
  template:
  ## View must be generated
  generate: true
  ## ... And have options
  options: []
</pre>

## Action

&rarr; [Default actions templates](help_templates_controller)

---
Actions are located in the `Sb/Console/Templates/<yourTemplate>/actions/` dir.
You can find more infos about actions templates and their configuration on [this help page](help_templates_actions)

<pre class="syntax yaml">
##
## This is a default action

  ## This is the path to the template
  ## Leave this blank in defaults or all your actions will use the same template as default.

  ## This section will contain the view configuration

  ## The difference between this and generate: set this to false and this action
  ## will not be referenced in any case.
  ## This is usefull when you want to discard a specific action, previously 
  ## defined in the default actions list.
  ## Leave this to false in defaults 
  blackListed: false
</pre>

## Actions
These are the default actions that must be created in each controller, listed by prefixes. If you don't want to use prefixes, define everything in the `public` prefix.

If you want to use more prefixes than the default "public" prefix, don't forget to specify them in your app's `Config/core.php`.

For a given plugin/part/controller, if you don't want to have one of the default actions, define it and set the `blackListed` option to `true` in its definition.

You can define options for the specific actions here, using the `action` 'pattern' (if you want to use a custom view or custom template for all the index actions)

## Snippets

&rarr; [Default model snippets](help_templates_models)

---
This section defines a model snippet.

Snippets are located in the `Sb/Console/Templates/<yourTemplate>/models/` dir.
You can find more infos about model snippets and their configuration on [this help page](help_templates_models)

## Part
This section defines a part configuration.

When you define a part, use the **Cake controller naming conventions** (TableName, CamelCased and plural form). This way, nameless models/controllers will base their names on it.
<pre class="syntax yaml">
##  
## Default part configuration
##
part:
  ## Generate this part ?
  ## This overrides under-levels "generate", as model:generate, controller:generate
  ## ...
  generate: true
  ## Have a model ?
  haveModel: true
  ## Model configuration
  model: []
  ## Have controller ?
  haveController: true
  ## Controller configuration
  controller: []
  ## Options that must be available in both model, controllers and views generation
  options: []
</pre>

Note that `haveModel` and `haveController` options are _really_ differents from the `generate` options in models/controllers definitions : if set to false, superBake will **NOT** reference any model or controller from this part in **ANY**.generated files. It must be set to false only if the part should NEVER have a model or a controller.
